# Contribution Guidelines

Please try to keep things in good shape and comply to what's there.

Use the feature branch workflow to add new features and make sure
to squash when merging into master:

	$ git merge cool_feature --squash

Then write a [good commit message][commit_messages] to keep the history
meaningful and useful. One feature, one commit.
